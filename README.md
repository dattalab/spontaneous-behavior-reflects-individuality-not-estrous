# Overview

The repository holds scripts used for data analysis for the publication: Mouse spontaneous behavior reflects individual variation rather than estrous state found here:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.02.035

Scripts are run in Jupyter Notebook and are organized by the corresponding figure panels. Default packages installed with Miniconda should account for the requirements of nearly all scripts in this repository.

Notebooks for FigS2A and S2F require the installation of the MoSeq app (available for free academic use here: https://dattalab.github.io/moseq2-website/index.html).

# Data


All Data necessary to run the notebooks is available to download from Zenodo.

Here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7622958

Data is to be saved in the same folder as the notebooks, but paths can be changed if necessary in each script.
